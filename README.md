# Non-Simulated Shared Ownership of scarce bitcoin with Multi Signatures in the Lightning Network

## Abstract

The universal axiom of scarcity is defined as the potential of conflict of control over a good. When Alice is utilizing a scarce good, Bob is excluded from using the same good at the same time but for a different task. Because of this fundamental rivalry over scarce goods, property rights emerge as a sound and logical structure to allocate resources throughout time. The binary opposite is a non-scarce good which is not restricted to individual control; it can be shared with whomever, without the need of sacrifice by the initial creator. Since non-scarce goods don't need to be allocated throughout time, property rights are neither necessary nor enforceable.

In Bitcoin, an unspent transaction output can only be spent when a previously-committed script is computed as valid. Bitcoin script is exhaustive with several `opcodes` which can be constructed into smart contracts. The most basic script is a `pay-to-single public key hash [P2PKH]`, where the knowledge of one private belonging to the address, the intent to transfer bitcoins to particular set of outputs and integrity of said intent proven with a cryptographic signature returns valid, and thus enables the transfer of bitcoin. Only with the knowledge of a non-scarce piece of information of the private key can the property rights of a scarce bitcoin be proven and enforced. Scripts can be constructed with `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`, where a coin can only be spent with m-of-n valid signatures. The Schnorr signature scheme can aggregate individual public keys and signatures for a more efficient and secure multisig implementation. Since a `UTXO` can only be spent within a threshold agreement between independent individuals, they have non-simulated shared ownership of scarce libre sound money.

The use cases of multi signatures are far reaching, including strengthening the property right defence of a single individual with several separated keys, shared ownership of funds between like-minded peers, escrow security for ensuring honest trades, or as a basis for advanced scripts like `paymentchannels` in the lightning network or atomic swaps.
