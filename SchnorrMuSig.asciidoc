# Schnorr Signatures

The Schnorr signature scheme footnote:[Claus-Peter Schnorr. Efficient Signature Generation by Smart Cards. J. Cryptology, 4(3):161–174, 1991.] uses a cyclic group `G` of prime order `p`, a generator `g` of `G`, and a hash function `H`. It uses a random number private key `x`, and public key `X`, with `(x, X) ∈ {0, …, p-1} * G` where `X = g^x`. To sign a message `m`, the signer generates a random number integer `r` in `Zp` and computes the nonce `R = g^r_, _c = H(X,R,m)`  footnote:[The key-prefix method with the hash of _R_ and _m_ as described by Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe, and Bo-Yin Yang. High-Speed High-Security Signatures. In Bart Preneel and Tsuyoshi Takagi, editors, Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems – CHES 2011, volume 6917 of LNCS, pages 124–142. Springer, 2011.], as well as `s = r + cx`. The signature σ is the tuple `(R,s)` and this can be verified by `g^s = RX^c`.

Just like ECDSA, the Schnorr signature scheme is proven secure under the discrete logarithm assumption, defined as followed. Let `(G,p,g)` be group parameters. An algorithm `A` is said to `(t,ԑ)`-solve the DL problem w.r.t. `(G,p,g)` if on input a random group element `X`, it runs in time at most `t` and returns `x ∈ {0, ..., p − 1}` such that `X = g^x` with probability at least ԑ, where the probability is taken over the random draw of `X` and the random coins of `A`. footnote:[See MuSig 2018 Chapter 2.1. Notation and Definitions]


# MuSig

The MuSig paper footnote:[Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Yannick Seurin, and Pieter Wuille. Simple Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Applications to Bitcoin. 2018] describes a simple and efficient multi-signature scheme based on Schnorr. Some of the benefits are key aggregation, signature aggregation and batch verification. The paper includes a security prove footnote:[See MuSig 2018, Chapter 4. Security of the New Multi-Signature Scheme] in the plain public-key model, which is omitted in this paper.

MuSig is parameterized by group parameters `(G,p,g)` where `p` is a `k`-bit integer, `G` is a cyclic group of order `p`, and `g` is a generator of `G`, and by three hash functions. footnote:[See MuSig 2018, Chapter 3. Our New Multi-Signature Scheme] The total signature size is `|G|+|p|`; the public key size `|G|`; and the private key size `|p|`.


## Key Generation

Individual private keys `x_i` are generated with a true random number generator and the public keys `X_i` are computed with `X_i = g^x_i`. The `X_1` and `x_1` are individual keys of a specific signer; `X_2, …, X_n` are the public keys of the cosigners; and `L = {pubk_1 = X_1, …, pubk_n = X_n}` is a multiset of all public keys. For `i ∈ {1, …, n}`, the signer computes `a_i = Hagg(L,X_i)` and then aggregates all the individual public keys into the single “aggregated” public key `Ẋ = X_i for 1` <= `X_i = n`, `Ẋ = product of X_i^a_i`.


## Signing

The signer has knowledge of aggregated `Ẋ`; the message `m` (in the context of Bitcoin `m` is the transaction according to the SIGHASH flag); and the multiset `L`. He generates another random integer `r_1` and computes the nonce of 'R_i for 1` <= `R_i` <= `n`, `R = product of all R_i`, and the commitment to that nonce `t_1 = H_com(R_1)`. The commitment `t_1` is shared with all cosigners, then in the next round of communication the nonce `R_1`, and we proceed with the protocol only if all `R` have been correctly committed for all `t_i = H_com(R_i)` with `i ∈ {2, …, n}`.

The signer computes `a_i = H_agg(L,X_i)`, `c = H_sig(Ẋ,R,m)` , and `s_1 = r_1 + ca_1x_1 mod p` , `s_1` is send to all cosigners. After all `s_2, …, sn` have been received, the signer computes let `s for 1` <= `s_i` <= `n`, `s = sum of all s_i'. The signature is `σ = (R,s)`.


## Verification
The verifier has a multiset of public keys `L`, a message `m`, and a signature `σ`. With this public information, the verifier computes `a_i`, `Ẋ` and `c`. The signature is valid only if `g^s = R (product of X_i^(a_i c)) = R Ẋ^c`. Due to key aggregation, the verification is similar to the standard Schnorr scheme, and secure variants of the MuSig scheme are discussed in the original paper footnote:[ MuSig 2018, Chapter 4.3 Discussion].


## Key Aggregation

As described earlier, each cosigner generates their own individual private public key pair `(X,x)`, and only that cosigner has knowledge of this secret key `x_i`. In the first round of communication, all cosigners share their public keys, anyone can build the multiset `L` and calculates `a_i` by hashing `L` and `X_i`. For `a_1`, the hash pre-image contains all the public keys once, but `X_1` twice. The aggregated public key `Ẋ` is indistinguishable from any other Schnorr public key. If only `Ẋ` is known, then the individual public keys `X_i` cannot be computed. Anyone with knowledge of all the public keys `X_i` can compute [and thus send bitcoin to] this aggregated public key `Ẋ`, without collaboration from the peers. Thus, the on-chain commitment to this MuSig is the exact same virtual size and has the same mining fee requirement as . Therefore, MuSig is both a privacy and scalability improvement.

Although there is the aggregated public key `Ẋ`, there is no “aggregated private key”. In order to produce a valid signature while defending against the rogue key attack footnote:[Thomas Ristenpart and Scott Yilek. The Power of Proofs-of-Possession: Securing Multiparty Signatures against Rogue-Key Attacks. In Moni Naor, editor, Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2007, volume 4515 of LNCS, pages 228–245. Springer, 2007.] footnote:[See MuSig 2018 chapter 5.3. Cross-Input Multi-Signatures], all cosigners have to collaborate in a three step footnote:[whilst a two-step round would be possible, it is larger in signature size and computational cost of signing and verification.] communication signing ceremony. First sharing a nonce commitment `t_i`, then the nonce `R_i`, and finally the partial signatures `s_i`. Only when all `i` partial signatures are available can the signer produce the valid signature `σ` which contains the aggregated nonce `R` and `s` part of the signature. The verifier knows only that [all of] the signer[s] has [have] agreed to that signature and thus the spending of the bitcoin, but he does not know whether this is only one single key pair, or several key pairs in aggregation. Further, it could be a collaborative lightning network channel close, a collaborative taproot footnote:[Maxwell. Taproot: Privacy preserving switchable scripting. Bitcoin-dev mailing list.
